# Project Title

Design and Implementation of Autonomous Text-Independent Speaker Recognition using an STM32F429i

## Getting Started

This Project contains the code from my Thesis Research. 
It was conducted in Circuits & Systems Group under the supervision of Dr. P.P.Sotiriadis from August 2017 to May 2018.

In this diploma thesis, a text-independent speaker recognition system is going to be designed
and implemented. Utilizing a short term spectral characteristic extraction method, the Mel-
Frequency Cepstral Coeffcients (MFCC) which is considered a state-of-the-art method for speech
processing. As a classifer an Artifcial Neural Network (ANN) is going to be used in order to
classify the extracted characteristics. Furthermore, we used a metric utilizing the number of
identifed inputs for each user in order make a decision.
